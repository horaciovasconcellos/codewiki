## About this Checklist

This CI/CD checklist is your roadmap to go from a manual, error-prone deployment
process to an automated, efficient release workflow.

This guide addresses the challenges teams run into when implementing Continuous
Integration and Continuous Delivery.

Whether you are just getting started with CI/CD or optimizing existing pipelines,
this checklist helps you implement production best practices to:

- Reduce deployment stress
- Improve code quality
- Deliver value faster and more reliably

Automation is an investment that pays dividends through:
- More stable releases
- Happier developers
- Better software

**Happy building!**

# Continuous Integration (CI) Checklist

## Version Control Best Practices

- Implement a branching strategy (feature branches, main/master branch)
- Encourage small, frequent commits
- Set up branch protection rules
- Prevent direct pushes to main
- Require code reviews before merging

## Automated Testing for CI

- Run automated tests on every commit in feature branches
- Add functional tests to validate features
- Configure linting and code style enforcement
- Ensure tests pass before merging to main
- Set up notifications for test failures

## Integration Process

- Implement automated merge conflict detection
- Set up test coverage reporting
- Configure dependency vulnerability scanning
- Create automated developer feedback mechanisms

---

# Continuous Delivery (CD) Checklist

## Deployment Automation

- Automate artifact creation (Docker images, packages)
- Implement automatic versioning and tagging
- Configure artifact repositories
- Automate deployment to development environments

## End-To-End Validation

- Run automated end-to-end tests
- Implement integration tests across services
- Configure automated security scanning
- Set up performance baseline testing
- Implement automated rollback mechanisms
- Create validation gates between environments

## Pre-Production Deployment

- Automate deployment to staging/test environments
- Mirror staging with production as closely as possible
- Configure compliance checks if required
- Set up approval gates before production deployment

---

# Continuous Deployment Checklist

## Production Deployment Strategy

- Implement deployment strategies (Canary, Blue-Green, etc.)
- Enable progressive rollouts
- Configure automated traffic shifting
- Use feature flags for controlled releases
- Set up automatic rollback triggers

## Monitoring & Observability

- Configure health checks
- Implement centralized logging
- Set up alerting for critical issues
- Enable performance monitoring
- Create dashboards for deployment status

## Feedback & Improvement

- Collect feedback from production deployments
- Perform post-deployment verification
- Track deployment success metrics
- Schedule regular pipeline reviews
- Measure deployment frequency and lead time

---

# Infrastructure and Tooling

## CI/CD Pipeline Infrastructure

- Select CI/CD tools (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps, etc.)
- Implement pipeline as code (Jenkinsfile, YAML workflows)
- Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for environments
- Configure access controls and permissions
- Ensure pipeline scalability for team growth

---

# Advanced CI/CD Considerations

## Security Integration (DevSecOps)

- Implement SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
- Set up DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)
- Configure container security scanning
- Monitor dependency vulnerabilities
- Validate compliance requirements
- Scan code for exposed secrets

## Optimization

- Implement caching strategies to speed up builds
- Enable parallel test execution
- Use pipeline analytics to identify bottlenecks
- Configure self-healing for common environment issues
